                        Having worked with the Department of Defense, Marquess saw how
                        critical OpenSSL was, not just to their software, but to other industries
                        around the world, from enterprise to aeronautics to health care.
                        Until that moment, he had “always assumed, (as had the rest of the
                        world) that the OpenSSL team was large, active, and well resourced.” In
                        reality, OpenSSL wasn’t even able to support one person’s work.

                    <li>This is something that a number of companies in Europe have understood, and as I relocated in France, two large companies based in France contacted me (as a member of the Jupyter team) and <strong>offered to make a donation</strong> to help the project grow, for a total of around 100k euros.</li>
                    <li>One issue is that we did not even know how to take the money. we don't have a single non-profit legal entity that could be a recipent to such a donation in France, and could make it tax deductible.</li>
                    <li>This is what the <strong>NumFOCUS foundation</strong> is about: serving as an umbrella organization for a large number of open-source projects to receive corporate and public funding, mutualising the administrative cost accross multiple projects.</li>
                    <li>Even on opensource projects that have most of their core developers located in Europe, <strong>leadership and governance</strong> often are located in the US. Why? Because we don't have the equivalent to NumFOCUS. Now it is clear that we need it - and we are now already working on it with the leadership of several open-source projects to make it happen sooner rather than later.</li>
